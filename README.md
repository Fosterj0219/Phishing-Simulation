# Phishing-Simulation Tool
This is our phishing campaign simulation tool, design for ethical hacking purposes. ONLY Attempt this on your own secured network. 

Overview -This tool is designed to simulate a phishing attempt email using the javax.mail API. It is part of a collaborative project that demonstrates how attackers try to trick users into revealing their credentials by creating a false sense of urgency. The purpose of this simulation is to raise awareness about how realistic phishing attempts can appear, and to help users recognize and avoid them.

* IMPORTANT * 
This project is a phishing campaign simulation tool created for ethical hacking and cybersecurity education.  
 Use ONLY on personally owned or explicitly authorized systems.


The primary goal of this project is to:
- Raise awareness about phishing attacks
- Educate users on how phishing messages are structured
- Simulate these attacks safely without sending real emails
