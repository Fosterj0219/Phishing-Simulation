# Phishing-Simulation
This is our phishing campaign simulation tool, design for ethical hacking purposes. ONLY Attempt this on your own secured network. 

Overview -This tool is designed to simulate a phishing attempt email using the javax.mail API. It is part of a collaborative project that demonstrates how attackers try to trick users into revealing their credentials by creating a false sense of urgency. The purpose of this simulation is to raise awareness about how realistic phishing attempts can appear, and to help users recognize and avoid them.
